This project analyzes the relationship between tobacco use, economic factors, and mortality rates in the UK from **2004‚Äì2015**.  
It combines **data cleaning, exploratory analysis, feature engineering, machine learning**, and a **live Streamlit dashboard** to predict and explain mortality patterns related to smoking.

---

## üìà **Project Objectives**

- Analyze trends in tobacco use, price indices, income, and mortality.
- Predict **mortality rate (`Death_Rate`)** using regression.
- Classify diagnoses into **High vs Low Fatality** based on historical fatality counts.
- Deploy an **interactive web app** for real-time scenario testing.

---

## üóÇÔ∏è **Data Sources**

- Annual survey and administrative health data covering:
  - Smoking prevalence
  - Tobacco Price Index & Retail Prices Index
  - Real household disposable income
  - ICD10 diagnoses
  - Admissions & fatalities (`Value_adm`, `Value_fat`)
  - Engineered interaction features

---

## üî¨ **Processes**

### ‚úÖ 1. Data Cleaning & Preparation
- Removed missing target rows for both regression and classification tasks.
- Cleaned column names to fix hidden line breaks (`\n`, `\r`).
- Encoded categorical variables (`ICD10 Diagnosis`, `Diagnosis Type`).
- Standardized numeric features for ML modeling.

### ‚úÖ 2. Feature Engineering
- Created `SmokingPrice_Interaction` to capture the combined impact of smoking prevalence and price.
- Binarized `Value_fat` into `High_Fatality` class using the median.

### ‚úÖ 3. Exploratory Analysis
- Confirmed trends: increasing tobacco prices, declining smoking rates.
- Noted high fatality risk in cancers & circulatory diseases.
- Detected clear correlations between price, prevalence, and mortality.

### ‚úÖ 4. Model Training
- **Regression:**
  - Linear Regression RMSE: **3967.65**, R¬≤: **0.9971**
  - Random Forest RMSE: **2466.61**, R¬≤: **0.9989**
- **Classification:**
  - Random Forest Accuracy: **98%**
  - ROC AUC: **0.9993**
  - Confusion Matrix:
    ```
    [[67  0]
     [ 3 80]]
    ```
  - Precision, Recall, F1 all at **0.98+**

### ‚úÖ 5. Deployment
- Packaged as a **Streamlit app** with:
  - Mode switch: Regression or Classification
  - User inputs for all key factors
  - Real-time predictions with **SHAP** explanations for feature impact

---

## üèÜ **Key Insights**

- Mortality rates strongly depend on:
  - Smoking prevalence & intensity
  - Tobacco pricing
  - Household income
  - Policy era & demographics
  - Specific diagnoses

- Effective pricing & policy can reduce smoking prevalence and lower smoking-related deaths.
